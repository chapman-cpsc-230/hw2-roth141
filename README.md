This homework involved manipulating sum powers and completing the rate of cooling.

## What I Learned from This

I learned how to find the ith sum of a problem as well as find the rate at which something cools, while using the while loop. _

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
